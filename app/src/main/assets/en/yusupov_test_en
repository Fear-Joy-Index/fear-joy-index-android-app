Adults and children are willing to trust you with their secrets and go for advice. Often you experience a guilt complex, fearing to cause trouble to people; not only with a word, but even with a look, you are afraid to hurt them. At the same time, they are very vulnerable. You can suffer at the sight of a crippled animal or not find a place for yourself from the occasional cold greeting of your boss. Your impressionability sometimes does not allow you to fall asleep for a long time. Being upset, you need emotional support from the outside.
